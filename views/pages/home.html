<!-- This means "when someone asks for 'homePage', give them the full base layout". The base layout then has a spot for content: -->
<!-- new homepage that renders the whole thing with all css and base -->
{{ block "homePage" . }}
    {{ template "baseLayout" . }}
{{ end }}

<!-- this block will be using targeted rendering ... WITHOUT BASE -->
{{ define "homeContent" }}  <!-- Use define instead of block here -->
    {{range .}}
            {{template "singleStoryBlock" .}}
    {{end}}
{{ end }}
